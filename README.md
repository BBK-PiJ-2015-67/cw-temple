PiJ Coursework 4 - George Osborne and the Temple of Gloom

# Phases

## Exploration
Ugh - trying to use some sort of PQ-based search rather than the traditional DFS/BFS searches
but struggling to figure out the logic. Will get there eventually but if not will fall back on
a simpler approach.

## Escape
- Use threading?
    - Thread safe data structures
- Some sort of heuristics needed to keep track of best score
